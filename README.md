I'm a Linux and Cloud engineer developing software in Go, C, Rust, Python and all manners of Lisp and Scheme.  I currently work for HDI Systems in the Cloud Competence Centre, in Hannover, Germany.  In the past I've had the fortune to work for Canonical, Thomson Reuters, Heetch and Cmed Technology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on everything and anything.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just spent some time learning Rust, and now I'm going back to look at Carp again.
  - If you're interested, I think Rust does a lot of important things, but it suffers from C++ disease (too much syntax, too many concepts).  I like that it lets me work in a fairly functional style, but I still don't love it (sorry rustaceans!)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with XLSX - a go library I wrote more than a decade ago.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, you never know I *might* answer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tealeg@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I basically never use Excel.
